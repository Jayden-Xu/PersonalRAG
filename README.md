# RAG System Deployment Guide

This repository provides a **step-by-step guide** to deploy a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using the open-source engine [RAGFlow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow).

## Caution: Architecture Compatibility

The server setup in this repository is based on the **ARM64** architecture (e.g., Apple Silicon Mac).

> If you are using an **x86-based** machine (e.g., Intel or AMD CPUs), please refer to the official [RAGFlow documentation](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow) for the appropriate Docker configuration, as the Dockerfiles may differ.

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jayden-Xu/RAG
cd RAG
```

## Step 1: Host RAGFlow Locally

```bash
cd docker
docker compose -f docker-compose-macos.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose-macos.yml up -d
```

Once the containers are built and started, they should be running in the background.

### Access the Web Interface

Open your browser and visit:

```
https://127.0.0.1
```

You should be redirected to the **RAGFlow frontend**.

### What‚Äôs Next? *(to be explained in detail in later parts)*

1. Add your **model APIs** through the interface.
2. Upload your **custom knowledge base**.
3. Start chatting with your local RAG system!

## Step 2: Host on a Public Domain and Allow External Access

### 1. Set up a DuckDNS Domain

Go to [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) and log in or register. Create a subdomain of your choice.

Then retrieve your **public IP address** using:

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

Update the **Current IP** on DuckDNS with the result above.  
A **token** will be generated ‚Äî keep it safe, as it will be used later with Let's Encrypt for SSL certification.

---

### 2. Configure Port Mapping on the Router

Log in to your router admin panel (e.g., `https://192.168.110.1`) and navigate to:

```
Devices ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Config ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Port Mapping
```

Click the **Edit** button and ensure the following settings are in place:

- **External Port**: `5000`  
  ‚Üí This is the port through which your DuckDNS domain (e.g., `yourdomain.duckdns.org:5000`) will be accessed from the internet.

- **Internal Port**: `81`  
  ‚Üí The port on your local machine (e.g., Mac) that the router will forward requests to.

- **Internal IP Address**: Your local machine‚Äôs IP address (e.g., `192.168.110.12`)  
  ‚Üí This must be the **internal IP** of the machine hosting RAGFlow.

This setup ensures that **external traffic** to your DuckDNS domain is correctly **routed to your machine** where RAGFlow is running.

---

## Step 3: Use Let's Encrypt to Enable HTTPS

To secure your domain with HTTPS, you'll use **Let's Encrypt** via **Certbot** and a DNS challenge script.

---

### 1. Check if Certbot and Nginx are installed

Run the following commands:

```bash
which certbot
which nginx
```

If Certbot is not installed, install it using:

```bash
brew install certbot
```

---

### 2. Request an SSL Certificate with Certbot

After installation, run the following command to generate your certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --manual \
  --preferred-challenges dns \
  --manual-auth-hook ~/duckdns-hook.sh \
  -d your_domain.duckdns.org
```

> üîÅ Replace `your_domain` with your actual DuckDNS subdomain.

Follow the instructions shown in the terminal, and choose the options as prompted.

---

### 3. Verify Your `duckdns-hook.sh` Script

Make sure your DNS hook script includes the correct DuckDNS token.

Open the script to edit:

```bash
nano ~/duckdns-hook.sh
```

Ensure it contains:

```bash
token=<your-duckdns-token>
```

This script will automatically update the DNS TXT record for validation.

---

Once the certificate is issued, it will be saved under:

```
/etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.duckdns.org/
```

These certificate files will be referenced in the next step for NGINX configuration.
