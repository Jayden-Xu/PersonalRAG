## Mobile Compatibility

Unfortunately, the default UI of RAGFlow is not optimized for mobile devices, making it difficult to use on smaller screens. To ensure that mobile users can still access the chat functionality, we need to provide a solution.

A simple solution is to use the **embedding feature** provided by RAGFlow, which allows us to integrate the chat interface into a separate URL, making it more mobile-friendly.
